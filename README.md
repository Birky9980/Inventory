Here’s an overview of the Birky_Inventory.py code:

This is a desktop application built with Tkinter for managing a weapon inventory. It uses a SQLite database (weapon_inventory.db) to store weapon details and supports image storage (photos of weapons) using the Pillow library. The app allows users to add, edit, delete, search, and view weapons, with fields for make, model, caliber, serial number, purchase/manufacture dates, cost, type, action, condition, notes, and photo.

Key features and structure:
- **Database Setup**: On startup, it initializes the SQLite database and creates the `weapons` table if it doesn’t exist.
- **Main UI**: The main window displays a table (Treeview) of weapons, with buttons for all major actions (Add, Edit, Delete, Search, Refresh, Show Photo, Backup DB, Export CSV, Show/Hide Columns, Exit).
- **WeaponEntryDialog**: A custom dialog for adding/editing weapons, with validation for required fields, dates, and cost. It also allows selecting and previewing a photo.
- **CRUD Operations**: Functions for adding, editing, deleting, and searching weapons interact with the database and update the UI.
- **Image Handling**: Photos are stored as blobs in the database and can be previewed in the UI.
- **Export/Backup**: Inventory can be exported to CSV, and the database can be backed up.
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Common actions are bound to keyboard shortcuts (e.g., Ctrl+N for add, Ctrl+E for edit).
- **Column Visibility**: Users can show/hide columns in the table.
- **Error Logging**: Errors are logged to a file with restricted permissions.
